# UX Notes â€“ Captaincy Showdown

Date: 2025-08-17

- Selection banner says "up to 3" but the current compare flow is most useful at exactly 2.
  - Later options: cap at 2 and update copy; or keep 3 and add a 3-up comparison layout.

- Small screens: PlayerCards feel squeezed while the Quick Comparison panel is too wide.
  - Consider shrinking/stacking Quick Comparison under cards at < md breakpoints.
  - Give PlayerCard a min-width and use size="small" variant in comparison on narrow viewports.
  - Tune container classes and typography for sm/md.

Follow-up (post-EPIC B): review responsive tweaks and selection cap decision.
