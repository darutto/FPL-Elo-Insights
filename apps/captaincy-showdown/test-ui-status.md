# UI Testing Status - Captaincy Showdown

## Phase 0 Test Results ✅

### ✅ Project builds without errors
- TypeScript compilation: **PASSED**
- Vite build: **PASSED**
- Build output: 165.65 kB (54.26 kB gzipped)

### ✅ Can load and parse sample CSV data
- CSV data loader implemented with Papa Parse
- Data files copied to public directory:
  - `/data/2025-2026/playerstats.csv` (679 players)
  - `/data/2025-2026/players.csv` (player names, teams, positions)
  - `/data/2025-2026/teams.csv` (team information)
- Data service joins multiple CSV files correctly

### ✅ TypeScript types compile correctly
- `CaptainCandidate` interface defined
- `MatchupData` interface defined
- All imports and exports working

### ✅ Basic component renders
- App component displays captain candidates
- PlayerCard component shows all required data fields:
  - Player name
  - Team
  - Position
  - Price (£X.Xm format)
  - Ownership percentage
  - Form score
  - Fixture difficulty
  - xGI per 90 minutes
  - Minutes risk
  - **Captain Score** (calculated composite score)

## Current UI Features

### Data Display
- Shows top 10 captain candidates for GW1
- Each player card includes all relevant metrics
- Captain score is prominently displayed in blue
- Clean card-based layout with shadows

### Layout & Styling
- Responsive flexbox layout
- Cards are 16rem width
- Gray background (#f3f4f6)
- White cards with subtle shadows
- Good typography hierarchy

### Data Flow
1. App loads → `getCaptainCandidates(1)`
2. Service loads 3 CSV files in parallel
3. Data is joined: playerstats + players + teams
4. Captain scores calculated using the algorithm
5. Top candidates displayed in UI

## Captain Score Algorithm
```
Score = (Form * 0.4) + (Fixture * 0.3) + (xGI * 0.2) + (Minutes Certainty * 0.1)
```

## Testing URLs
- Main App: http://127.0.0.1:5174/
- Data Test: http://127.0.0.1:5174/data/2025-2026/playerstats.csv

## Next Steps for Phase 1
- Enhance fixture difficulty calculation
- Optimize data loading performance  
- Add error handling for missing data
- Implement proper loading states
- Add unit tests for the captain score engine

## Status: ✅ Phase 0 COMPLETE
Ready to proceed to Phase 1: Data Processing Engine
