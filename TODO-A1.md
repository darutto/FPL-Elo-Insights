# TODO for Epic A1

- [ ] Implement enrichWithRecentPerformance (rolling xGI/90, recent starts/mins)
- [ ] Use enricher in captaincyDataService before mapping
- [ ] Mapper: prefer rolling_xgi_per_90; adjust minutes_risk using recent starts/mins
- [ ] EnhancedApp: loading state on fetch; empty state when 0 results
- [ ] EnhancedApp: pushState for season/GW changes
- [ ] Tests: enricher unit tests and integration smoke
